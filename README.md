## Setup

### 1. Get Your Notion API Key

1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name it "Leetion" and select your workspace
4. Copy the "Internal Integration Token"

### 2. Create Your Notion Database

Create a new database in Notion. You do not need to add columns by hand:
when you first save a problem, Leetion shows you the list of columns it
needs and adds the missing ones after you confirm. It never renames or
deletes columns you created.

These are the exact column names and types Leetion uses:

| Property                | Type                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Question                | Title                     |
| S No.                   | Number                    |
| Level                   | Select (Easy/Medium/Hard) |
| Tag                     | Multi-select              |
| My Expertise            | Select (Low/Medium/High)  |
| Done                    | Checkbox                  |
| Date (of first attempt) | Date                      |
| Question Link           | URL                       |
| Remark                  | Rich text                 |
| Alternative Method Tags | Multi-select              |
| Spaced Repetition       | Date                      |
| Time Complexity         | Select                    |
| Space Complexity        | Select                    |
| Attempts                | Number                    |

If you add these yourself, the names must match exactly — a column with a
different name (even the same type) is treated as a separate column. The
title column is the one exception: Leetion writes the problem title to your
database's existing title column, whatever it is named.

> **Upgrading from an older setup?** Earlier versions of this README listed
> different column names (for example a "Date" date column instead of
> "Date (of first attempt)", or "Review" instead of "Spaced Repetition").
> If your database has both an old-name column and its Leetion-created
> counterpart, the old one is an unused duplicate. Leetion never deletes
> columns, so merge or remove the leftover columns manually in Notion.

### 3. Connect the Database

1. Open your Notion database
2. Click "..." menu → "Connections" → Add your "Leetion" integration
3. Copy the database ID from the URL:

```
https://notion.so/workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...
```

### 4. Configure Leetion

1. Click the Leetion extension icon
2. Enter your API key and Database ID
3. Click "Save Settings"

## Usage

1. Navigate to any LeetCode problem
2. Write your solution in the editor
3. Click the Leetion extension icon
4. Click "Save Solution" to capture your current code
5. Fill in optional details (complexity, notes, etc.)
6. Click "Save to Notion" to sync everything

**Tips:**

- Use multiple snapshots to save different approaches
- The form auto-saves locally, so you won't lose work
- Spaced repetition dates are calculated automatically
- Tags are auto-detected from LeetCode's problem tags
